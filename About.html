        <h3> Crossiant defined</h3>
        A croissant (UK: /ˈkrwʌsɒ̃, ˈkrwæsɒ̃/, US: /krəˈsɒnt, krwɑːˈsɒ̃/; French: [kʁwasɑ̃] ) is a French pastry made from puff pastry in a crescent shape
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        
        It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl, but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.[3] Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.

    <p><h3> Crossiant history</h3>
        Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity.[4] The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century, when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with a yeast-leavened laminated dough.
